Resources used :
¬¬Visual Studio Code as Code Editor & Google Chrome as a Browser along with I had used some extensions of VS Code such as Lorem ipsum for dummy texts and Live Server for the real-time output of the changes made in the project. 
Learning Outcomes: 
•	I added a favicon on all the pages.
•	I’m using Google Fonts “Poppins” as a custom font for the entire project.
•	Also, I used the FontAwesome for Icons.
•	The body of each page is divided into three parts – header, main section, and footer.
•	All three sections are separated by using <hr> tags.
•	I had used comments as much as possible.
•	Headings of all the pages are using <h1> tag
•	All the images are aligned with the padding property and table tag.
 	Header
-  the header consists of a logo by <img> tag and with the help of <span> tag I had separated the Logo text “APNA BIHAR” for two different colours.
	-  Also the header contains the Menu with FontAwesome icons which 	 are interlinked properly for easy navigation 	across the website.
 	Main Section 
- this content in this section varies according to the page.
	Home Page
- About Bihar includes <h3> tag and <p> tag
- The section Images of Some Popular places of Bihar & Images: Some Glimpses of Popular Cities of Bihar is created with the help of the <table> tag. I had maintained a consistent size of 300px * 250px for all the images.

- It also includes <iframe> tag which is hyperlinked to the About Us page, having height: 400px and width: 1400px.
